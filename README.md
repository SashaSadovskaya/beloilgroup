# About
In this project I have learned the next technologies:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- git
    
In html5 I have knew the next tags:
- section
- header
- aside
- footer
- nav
- main

I also learned how to embed a map to the site.
In css I have knew the next properties:
- flex-basic(this property sets the base size of the flex element along the main axis. This property determines the size of the content box):
    - width ( px, em, % and other)
     - auto
     - initial 
     - inherit
- flex-wrap ( this property sets the rules for displaying flex elements. If it is allowed, you can specify the direction):
    - nowrap 
    - wrap 
    - wrap-reverse 
    - initial 
    - inherit
- align-items (this property specifies the default alignment for items inside the flexible container):
    -  flex-start 
    -  flex-end 
    -  center 
    -  baseline 
    -  stretch
    
I also learned some commands in GIT:
- git status (shows the status of files in the working directory and indexes)
- git add (adds the contents of the working directory to the index (staging area) for the next commit)
- git commit (takes all the data added to the index using git add and stores their nugget in the internal database, and then shifts the index of the current branch to this nugget)
- git rm (uses Git to remove files from the index and working directory)
- git branch (it is able to list your branches, create new ones, delete and rename them)
- git pull (takes changes from the specified remote repository, and then tries to merge them with the current branch)
- git push (it is used to establish a connection with a remote repository, calculate local changes that are absent in it, and actually transfer them to the above-mentioned repository)
- git init (creates in the current directory a new subdirectory named .git containing all the necessary repository files)
